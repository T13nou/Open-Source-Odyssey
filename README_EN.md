# I. Introduction <a name="introduction"/>

Welcome to my page dedicated to my 100% open source adventure.  Here I share my personal journey towards exclusively using open source tools in my daily life.  My approach revolves around open collaboration, the power of community and my commitment to computer privacy and digital hygiene.

At the heart of my journey, I set up an infrastructure at home, including an open source router, a NAS server dedicated solely to open source productivity tools, and even converted my gaming PC using Arch Linux, as well as a portable game console running under the same distribution.  I have chosen to no longer use any proprietary products, and I strive to share my experience and encourage those around me to understand this philosophy.

Furthermore, I chose to put this article on GitHub which seems to me to be an appropriate place to share my approach with the community and allow everyone to contribute to it.

What this article is not a technical guide, others already do, but I would direct you to very specialized and relevant resources on the different subjects that I address.

Join me to discover how open source can not only offer an alternative to proprietary software, but also promote digital freedom, the security of our data, and collective innovation.  Together, we will explore the benefits of open source, its transformative potential, and the joys of living a more transparent digital life that respects our individual rights.  Welcome to my 100% open source world!

## Who am I ?

As I journey towards exclusively using open source tools and explore open collaboration, it is essential to understand the context and experience that led me to this journey.  Here is an overview of who I am, my professional journey, and what drives me in this adventure towards a more open and collaborative digital world.

You can learn more about my professional background by consulting my profile [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/etienneblanchet/)

My passion for open source and open collaboration is rooted in a deep conviction: technology can be used to bring people together, facilitate the sharing of ideas and solve complex problems collectively.  My career has led me to work on various projects, from the design of electronic solutions to the implementation of open source frameworks within my company.

Today, I apply these principles of openness and collaboration in my personal and professional life.  My commitment to open source and open collaboration is based on the belief that these approaches can transform the way we work, innovate and build a better digital future for all.

# II.  Why Open Source?  <a name="why"/>

<img src="https://github.com/T13nou/Open-Source-Odyssey/blob/main/pictures/pinguin.png" width="1000" height="250">

When I began my journey to exclusively using open source tools, I was influenced by several key factors that shaped my perspective on digital life.  These influences have reinforced my belief that open source is the way forward for a more secure, transparent and ethical digital future.

One of my first major influences was the article by Larry Sanger, the co-founder of Wikipedia, entitled [*The Challenges of Locking Down My Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãLife*](https://larrysanger.org/2019/ 07/the-challenges-of-locking-down-my-cyber-life), published in 2019. In this article, Sanger shares his thoughts on privacy and security issues. digital hygiene.  It highlights the threats to our personal data and the need to take steps to protect it.  This reflection was a major catalyst for me, prompting me to reconsider how I managed my own digital life.

Another crucial influence has been the growing awareness of the monetization of digital services by tech giants (GAFAM ‚Äì Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft).  Many companies make money by exploiting our personal data, which raises major privacy concerns.  Privacy experts and advocates, such as Shoshana Zuboff, in her book ["*The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*"](https://www.zulma.fr/livre/lage-du-capitalisme-de-surveillance -3/) explored these issues in depth (book that I highly recommend!).  Their work demonstrates the importance of protecting our data and seeking ethical alternatives.

One aspect that strengthened my resolve to adopt open source solutions was the concern for the privacy of my family, including my children.  I do not want to see them exposed on the Internet, whether voluntarily or involuntarily.  The potential impact on the lives of our loved ones is a powerful driver for adopting a more secure and respectful approach to privacy.

Finally, as an engineer, my faith in the future of technology lies in open source.  I deeply believe that open source offers a path to a brighter digital future.  It enables massive collaboration and transparency, two essential pillars of innovation and technological progress.

All of these influences converged to convince me to make the leap to open source, emphasize privacy, and promote a more ethical digital approach.  By embracing open source, I believe we can create a more secure, transparent and collaborative digital world for everyone.

## The advantages of open-source

### üÜì Freedom and Control

One of the biggest benefits of open source is the freedom and control it offers users.  Unlike proprietary software, open source software allows users to access the source code, modify it, and adapt it to their specific needs.  This flexibility is valuable whether you are an experienced user looking to customize a solution or a novice wanting to understand the inner workings of an application.

Furthermore, code reusability is possible and common.  We use the term *fork* to designate new software created from the source code of existing software.

### üîé Transparency and Security

Transparency is another pillar of open source.  Since the source code is publicly available, users can inspect, audit, and verify the security of open source software.  This reduces the risk of hidden security vulnerabilities or backdoors.  Additionally, the open source community is quick to patch vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered, helping to maintain a more secure digital environment.

### ü§ë Cost

Open source software is often available for free, which can significantly reduce costs for users and organizations.  You can use powerful software without having to pay for expensive licenses.  This allows access to high-quality tools, even on a limited budget.

It is fertile ground for NGOs, the education sector or simply for associations which aim to give a second lease of life to aging equipment.  Take a look at Linux distributions such as [Emmabunt√ºs](https://emmabuntus.org/la-distribution/), [AcademiX](https://academixproject.com/en/home/) or [Edubuntu](https: //www.edubuntu.org/).

### ü¶∏ Community and Active Support

Open source fosters an active and collaborative community of users and developers.  You can benefit from the expertise of a global community to solve problems, get tips, and discover new features.  Forums, newsgroups, and dedicated contributors are ready to help.

### üå≥ Long-Term Sustainability

Open source software is less likely to become obsolete or abandoned by its publisher because the responsibility for its development rests with the community rather than a single company.  This ensures the sustainability of open source solutions, which is crucial for long-term projects.

While writing this article I asked myself the question of *forks* and whether the most popular projects or those which are no longer maintained were regularly forked.  GitHub maintains its [Top-100](https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking/blob/master/Top100/Top-100-forks.md) of the most *forked* projects and surprise, some do have been more than 100,000 times.  The community is active!  ‚öôÔ∏è

### üí°Continuous Innovation

Open source encourages continuous innovation.  By allowing anyone to contribute to and improve software, open source promotes a rapid cycle of innovation.  Many open source projects are driving new ideas and technologies that impact the entire industry.

### üîí Respect for Privacy

With privacy concerns on the rise, open source offers a way to keep data confidential.  You have greater control over what is collected and shared, which is essential to protect your personal and sensitive information.

These cumulative benefits illustrate why open source has become much more than just an alternative to proprietary software.  It embodies a philosophy of collaboration, transparency and respect for individual freedom, while offering powerful and sustainable technological solutions.  My journey to open source has convinced me that these benefits are essential to shaping a more promising digital future.

I invite you to explore the subject with the channel of [Rob Braxman](https://www.youtube.com/@robbraxmantech), defining himself as an *Internet Privacy Evangelist*, an evangelist for respect for privacy. privacy on the Internet. His proposal is assumed to be extreme: he uses one device per use case (public, private), lives on a boat and regularly warns of the dangers of our technological environment.  He applies the *off the grid* principle of life to himself.  To be taken with a grain of salt but I agree with most of his articles.

# III.  Setting up the Open Source infrastructure <a name="infra"/>

<img src="https://github.com/T13nou/Open-Source-Odyssey/blob/main/pictures/build.png" width="1000" height="250">

The creation of a fully open source infrastructure was marked by the search for "quick wins", these small initial victories which reinforce the conviction that the chosen approach is the right one.  My journey began with inspiration from an article by Larry Sanger, co-founder of Wikipedia, where he shared his thoughts on privacy and digital hygiene.

However, to consolidate my first steps, I sought to cross-check this information with other trusted sources, in order to build a solid foundation for my open source infrastructure.  Among the resources that guided my choices, here are some of the most influential:

By drawing on these resources, I was able to lay the foundation for my open source infrastructure and strengthen my understanding of the tools and practices that ensure my privacy and security online.  These first steps helped me build a solid foundation for the rest of my journey towards exclusively using open source tools, focused on privacy, transparency and innovation."

## üåê Use an open-source web browser

The first step in my journey to an open source digital experience began with searching for an alternative to Google Chrome.  Although Chrome is a popular and efficient browser, I was increasingly aware of concerns around privacy and data collection.  So I set out to find an open source solution that could meet my web browsing needs.

After extensive research, Mozilla Firefox quickly became the solution of choice.  Mozilla, as a nonprofit organization, is strongly committed to online privacy.  Firefox is an open source browser that embodies these values, offering full transparency over its source code and open philosophy.  It‚Äôs a choice that perfectly suited my approach in favor of open source.

For managing my passwords, I opted for the Bitwarden extension, an open source password manager.  The advantage of Bitwarden is its compatibility with my self-hosted installation of Bitwarden on my NAS server.  This integration allows me to manage my passwords securely and store them locally, strengthening my online security.

When it comes to managing website, ad and malware filtering, I delegated this task to my OPNsense router.  This open source router is equipped with a DNS module based on filtering lists, similar to a Pi-Hole.  This solution allows me to actively block ads, trackers, and malicious websites at a central level, protecting all devices on my home network.  This not only enhances my privacy, but also the security of my online activities.

## üì´ Use a Privacy-Concerned Email Service

One of the first areas I wanted to address was email.  Choosing a suitable messaging service is of crucial importance as it affects the confidentiality of communications and the security of personal data.

I was particularly attentive to several aspects in my quest for an email service concerned with privacy:

1. Content Monetization: One of my main concerns was to avoid email providers that monetize their users' content.  Many large email platforms generate revenue by analyzing email content and displaying targeted advertisements.  This practice is contrary to my values ‚Äã‚Äãof privacy and respect for confidentiality.

2. Encryption at the Source: Email encryption is essential to prevent unauthorized interception of messages.  I looked for a provider that encrypts emails from the start, ensuring that only the sender and recipient have access to the content.  Encryption at the source is a fundamental element in guaranteeing the confidentiality of communications.

3. Hosted in Europe: As a privacy-conscious user, choosing the location of email servers is of crucial importance.  I opted for an email service hosted in Europe, which allows for strict data protection and privacy standards.  This adds an extra layer of security to my communications.

4. Avoiding ‚ÄúVendor Lock-In‚Äù: The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãremaining tied to a single email provider was contrary to my vision of an open and flexible digital environment.  I looked for a provider that didn't impose lock-in on a proprietary ecosystem, providing the ability to migrate to other services if necessary.

Among the options available to me
- Self-host my own email server: tricky to configure because it relies on security and antispam technologies that I have little control over :) Furthermore, email delivery requires a reliable connection available 365 days a year (or use a gateway most often paid).
- Use a paid solution from a third-party provider.

For my part, I only use email a little and what I receive is not critical, so I decided to make a compromise by making my life easier and choosing a provider who seems reliable and meets the above criteria. .

After looking at many options, I finally chose Soverin.net as my email provider.  While Soverin.net isn't necessarily perfect, it addresses several of my core concerns.  It does not monetize the content of my emails, offers robust encryption, is hosted in Europe, and does not "lock" me into a proprietary ecosystem.

This approach to electronic messaging is part of my overall approach to respecting privacy and promoting open source.  It ensures that my communications remain confidential, secure and under my control, while avoiding the intrusive practices and restrictions often associated with traditional email providers.  As part of my journey towards exclusively using open source tools, this decision reflects my commitment to computer privacy and digital hygiene.

The service is paid (~25‚Ç¨/$ per year) but it is an easy first step in my approach.

## üöß Control my data by hosting my own NAS server - The Beginning of HomeLabing

My journey to a fully open source infrastructure has also led me to rethink how I store and manage my data.  Initially, I used a proprietary NAS solution from Synology.  Although this option offered some stability, I quickly realized its limitations.  The environment was underperforming, and adding additional services was often complicated or impossible.

So I set out to research alternatives, considering various open source solutions.  I explored options like TrueNAS Core, Open Media Vault, and Unraid, each with their pros and cons.  After careful analysis, I finally opted for TrueNAS Scale, a solution based on a Debian base that I cherish for its openness and stability.

[TrueNAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/) won me over with its ZFS-based storage environment.  This file system offers many advantages, including the ability to create snapshots, its robustness, data deduplication, and compression.  These features are essential to guarantee the integrity of my data while optimizing storage space.

One of the strengths of TrueNAS Scale is its application catalog, which offers a variety of services, all in a containerized environment.  I have the choice between Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and manage my applications.  Additionally, TrueNAS Scale has KVM-based hypervisor functionality, which in my opinion remains a safe bet when it comes to virtualization.

Thanks to TrueNAS Scale, my NAS server now hosts a set of applications essential to my digital life.  NextCloud lets me store and sync my files securely, PhotoPrism manages my photo collection in an organized way, PleX gives me access to my media library, and Bitwarden takes care of managing my passwords securely.

However, I made the decision not to centralize everything on my NAS server.  Critical IT services, such as the OPNsense router, HAProxy reverse proxy, Let's Encrypt certificate management, as well as all services for securing my network and access to applications, are installed on dedicated hardware.  This approach ensures effective management of these crucial elements and strengthens the security of my network.  In the following chapters, I will detail the implementation of these essential services in more detail.

Here is the configuration I opted for in order to accomplish my goal
- Box: Kolink Satellite
- CPU: Intel 12100T
- Motherboard: Asrock Z690M-ITX/ax
- Ram: 2x 32GB Crucial
- Boot storage (boot-pool): 2 x 500GB Crucial MX500 SSD
- Main storage (data): 8 x 4TB Crucial MX500 SSD + LSI HBA 9300-8i
- Secondary storage (applications): 2 x 1TB Crucial P5 Nvme SSD

## üîë Have password hygiene and host them on my infrastructure

Like many of us, I once used a common password for most online services I signed up for.  This practice, although common, carries considerable online security risks.  Realizing these dangers prompted me to look for more secure and effective ways to manage my passwords.

My first attempt to remedy this situation was to use the password managers built into web browsers.  However, over time, I realized that I could not completely trust these managers, especially when it came to the security and control of my sensitive data.

So I adopted Keepass, an open source password manager.  Keepass has been with me for years, providing a secure solution for storing my passwords.  I even opted for cloud storage of my Keepass database, which allowed me to access my passwords from any of my devices.

However, over time I found that Keepass's approach became more and more tedious.  Managing local databases and synchronizing between devices required considerable effort.  That's when I seriously considered [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), an open source password manager, offering a more fluid and flexible solution.

One of the key advantages of Bitwarden is the ability to self-host your own password server.  This option allowed me to maintain full control of my sensitive data, without having to trust third parties.  Bitwarden apps are available for a multitude of operating systems, from desktop to mobile, making it much easier to manage passwords across all my devices.  In addition, these applications are designed to guarantee security even in the event of a connection loss, by caching and encrypting my password database.

The TrueNAS App Catalog also offers [VaultWarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), a community-run alternative implementation of Bitwarden.  Since 2019, I have used this service smoothly and without major concerns.  My passwords are stored securely and easily accessible.  This approach to password hygiene and self-hosting has been an essential component of my journey to a more secure and transparent digital experience.  It shows that open source solutions can offer robust and flexible alternatives for online security needs, which evolve over the years.

## üìÜ Take back control of my contact list and calendar

My professional journey has led me to work in the field of Digital Workplace, where collaboration, the adoption of tools and means of communication are essential pillars of collective success.  In this context, I had the opportunity to work with systems such as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, which offer a range of productivity and collaboration tools.  However, alongside these giants of the sector, I also discovered a more modest player, NextCloud, which aims to compete with the behemoths by offering an open source and self-hosted alternative.

My curiosity led me to explore this solution, even though in its first versions, NextCloud could be tricky to install and maintain.  My goal was clear: regain control of my contact list, my calendar, and my data, freeing myself from closed ecosystems such as Google Drive and Google Docs.

Several years have passed since my first steps with NextCloud, and the platform has evolved considerably.  It now offers various installation methods, making it more accessible for residential users.  It is compatible with many NAS, whether proprietary or open source.  For my part, I opted for a [NextCloud All-in-one](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one) installation on a virtual machine, which provides me with all the services I need. I need.

My personal NextCloud includes an email client, a CalDAV-enabled calendar, a CardDAV-enabled contact list, note-taking tools, a Kanban board, Doodle-like functionality, and most importantly, a file manager.  This last point is essential, because it allows me to access my information, whether from home, on the move, or by collaborating with other people.

NextCloud also offers an iOS client, which automates the upload of all my photos to my NextCloud server.  This feature adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that my memories are stored privately on my own server.

In addition, NextCloud has an integrated word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation tool, allowing us to work simultaneously on the same document, while preserving control of our data. Using NextCloud has become a habit in my family, with each member using it to collaborate and access their files remotely.  This transition to a self-hosted open source solution has increased my confidence in managing my personal data, while providing a smooth and secure collaboration experience.

## üõÇ Establish a reliable and secure network

The home network, by default, is often insecure and offers few features to facilitate self-hosting.  This is why, when I decided to commit to self-hosting my services, I quickly understood that I had to manage all aspects related to connectivity, security, and implementation. available to my online services.

Self-hosting your services involves making them available on the Internet, while guaranteeing their security.  That's when I started looking for a comprehensive solution to manage all of these aspects, including DNS, DHCP, security, and setting up a VPN. .

After testing different products, including routers from ASUS, Mikrotik, and pfSense, I finally settled on [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/).  OPNsense is an open source router/firewall solution that offers additional packages to enable the features I needed.  Its flexibility and customization capabilities convinced me.

PhasedLogix has an excellent playlist to get started with the solution.  The guy is clear and knows how to make a relatively austere solution accessible ü•á
[Learn OPNSense Firewall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLA1a7Xn924&list=PLCQ7UEq6XQ1GRtKpOkfxW6Oc_2VxkmRVc)
<img src="https://github.com/T13nou/Open-Source-Odyssey/blob/main/pictures/homelab/OPNsense.png" width="1000" height="408">

To ensure the reliability and security of my network, I chose to install OPNsense on bare metal hardware, meaning the software runs directly on dedicated hardware rather than in a virtual machine.  This decision was crucial, because the router/firewall plays an essential role in the security of my network.  Among the available options, I opted for hardware from the [ProtectLI](https://eu.protectli.com/) brand, which offers quality products with an open source BIOS, [CoreBoot](https:/ /www.coreboot.org/), in line with my open source philosophy.

Exposing my services on the Internet requires the use of a domain name, as well as subdomains to make each service individually accessible.  To manage this, I set up a reverse proxy [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/fr), which redirects requests based on the subdomain to the corresponding service.

Managing SSL/TLS certificates is essential to ensure secure connections.  Fortunately, there is a free certificate authority, Let's Encrypt, that allows you to obtain SSL/TLS certificates in an automated way.  OPNsense makes this easy by using the ACME plugin, which automatically renews certificates, whether wildcard or not, for all my subdomains.  So each service, whether it's NextCloud, Bitwarden, Plex, and many others, is accessible via a secure subdomain.

Internal DNS also plays a key role in resolving domain names inside my network.  I chose to use the unbound service on OPNsense, using spam domain filtering lists, similar to Pi-Hole.  The result is a browsing experience free of ads and intrusive windows across my entire home network.

So, establishing a reliable and secure network has become an essential part of my journey towards an open source-based digital experience, ensuring that my services are securely accessible, both from within and from outside. outside my home network.

I really like the way in which TechnoTim was able to popularize and explain security for Homelabing very well.  We cover the subjects of firewalls, reverse proxy, network segmentation, etc.

## üå≥ Ensuring ecological impact via a greenLabing approach

When committing to self-hosting your services, it is important to consider the ecological impact of this approach.  Indeed, the establishment of a personal infrastructure can lead to electricity consumption and expenditure on IT equipment, which must be balanced with an environmentally friendly approach.

With this in mind, I designed my self-hosting approach with energy efficiency and sustainability in mind.  Each of the devices I use was chosen for its low power consumption and longevity.  By combining these two factors, I was able to reduce the environmental impact of my infrastructure as much as possible.

All of my devices, three in number, consume a total of only 60 watts, the equivalent of what an older generation bulb would consume.  This low consumption is the result of careful selection of equipment and its sizing to guarantee optimal performance while limiting energy expenditure.

Additionally, some of my devices have been deliberately oversized to extend their lifespan and ensure compatibility with future technologies.  This technology-agnostic approach avoids frequent device replacements, thereby reducing the amount of electronic waste.

A real-world example of this approach is managing my wired and Wi-Fi network. I have deliberately separated the two devices, the router and the Wi-Fi access point, because Wi-Fi standards are evolving rapidly.  So when the next generation of Wi-Fi standard becomes available, I will only need to replace the access point, thereby preserving my router and avoiding unnecessary replacement of all equipment.

By ensuring the ecological impact of my self-hosting approach, I seek to reconcile the benefits of controlling my data and services with a commitment to sustainability and reducing my environmental footprint.  This approach is part of the GreenLabing philosophy, which consists of combining technology and respect for the planet for more responsible IT.

# IV.  Open Source Operating Systems <a name="os"/>

<img src="https://github.com/T13nou/Open-Source-Odyssey/blob/main/pictures/bureau.png" width="1000" height="250">

One of the biggest milestones in my journey to exclusively using open source tools was my move to an open source operating system for my workstation.  This change happened thanks to a click, a revelation that came in the form of a gaming device: the [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/fr), a portable gaming console based on Arch Linux.

As a video game enthusiast, I was impressed by the commitment of the company [Valve](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_(company)) to make an impressive number of games compatible, originally intended for Windows, with Linux.  This bold move caught my attention and aroused my curiosity.

This is how I felt the desire to learn more about this operating system, to dive into the world of Linux, and to see if it could meet my needs beyond gaming. My journey naturally led me to join the [Gaming Linux FR](https://www.gaminglinux.fr/) community, where I was able to find help and advice to ease my transition from Windows to Linux.

What struck me most about this experience was the open-mindedness, the willingness to share and the dedication of the open source community to helping as many people as possible make this transition.  I quickly realized that the open source philosophy was ingrained in the DNA of this community.  Everyone was ready to share their knowledge, solve problems and make Linux accessible to everyone.

After testing different Linux distributions, including Debian, Fedora and OpenSUSE, I finally found my sweet spot with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).  This open source operating system matched my needs 100%.  It offered me the flexibility and customization I needed to tailor my work environment to my preferences.

* You want an overview of existing distributions, the reference remains [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/)!
* You want to try the distributions without installing them (or even booting from a Live ISO) [DistroSea](https://distrosea.com/) will allow you to test in a VM within your browser :)

With Arch Linux, I was able to work efficiently using only open source applications, while retaining some [*Progressive Web Apps*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) of the Microsoft applications that were essential.  This transition showed me that open source was not only a viable option, but could also meet any need, whether it was productivity, entertainment, or any other aspect of digital life.

My adventure with Arch Linux has reinforced my belief that open source is much more than an alternative to proprietary software.  It is an open, collaborative and dedicated community, ready to support users in their exploration of a freer and more transparent digital future.

I attended with great interest the [Interview with an Arch Linux packager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXvzGRm9iFs) where I was able to get a more precise idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe care taken by the community to deliver a satisfactory experience to its users and minimizing instabilities and other bugs.

# V. Open Collaboration and the Power of Community <a name="collab"/>

<img src="https://github.com/T13nou/Open-Source-Odyssey/blob/main/pictures/community.png" width="1000" height="250">

One of the most inspiring aspects of my journey to exclusively using open source tools is discovering open collaboration and the tremendous power of community that comes with it.  In this chapter, we will explore the benefits of open collaboration, collective innovation and community strength, highlighting the principles of this approach.

The Foundations of Open Collaboration

Open collaboration is a philosophy based on sharing, cooperation and openness.  It promotes collaboration between individuals and groups in a transparent, free and often decentralized manner.  This approach has profound implications, not only in the open source world, but also in the professional world.

## Decentralized collaboration and the richness of multicultural perspectives

One of the most exciting aspects of open collaboration is the opportunity to work with people from diverse countries, cultures and languages.  As a follower of this philosophy, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with individuals from all over the world, using languages ‚Äã‚ÄãI am fluent in such as French, English and Spanish.  This cultural diversity brings an infinite wealth of points of view, experiences and expertise.  It reinforces the idea that innovation is born from diversity.

‚ÄúCollaboration is an opportunity to discover new perspectives, to push the limits of creativity and to enrich our ideas thanks to the diversity of contributors.  ¬ª - [Quote from Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux]

## The power of asynchronous collaboration

One of the key strengths of open collaboration is the flexibility it offers through asynchronous working.  Working with individuals spread across different time zones means that collaboration can continue 24 hours a day. Contributions can be made based on each person's availability, creating a continuous working dynamic.  This allows you to take full advantage of available talent, regardless of geographic location.

Some training courses exist and are very enriching.  I followed them and try to integrate the key concepts into my daily life.
- Limit the use of emails and encourage the use of a single repository for writing, documenting and interacting.  It is a ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù which facilitates information, onboarding and avoids dispersion.
- Use persistent chats so that whatever the geographical area of ‚Äã‚Äãan individual, they can learn about exchanges during their working hours.  Many tools exist: Discord, Teams, Slack, NextCloud Chat.
- Develop your relationships remotely: virtual caf√©s, cross-country projects, peer reviews between geographic areas, all these solutions form a solid basis for asynchronous collaboration.

I cannot recommend GitLab's work on the subject highly enough.  Gitlab has thoroughly developed its All-Remote strategy and, as they apply their principles well, everything is documented on "GitLab's Guide to All-Remote"

The training provided by GitLab is excellent.  This requires practice and returning to it regularly to refocus on its application.

|  Training |  Content |
|  ------------- |  ------------- |
|  [Remote Team Management](https://www.coursera.org/learn/remote-team-management#modules)|  Leading in a Remote Environment, Building a Remote Organizational Culture and Practices, Assessing Teams' and Managers' Readiness for Remote Work, Creating a Baseline Strategy for Implementing a Remote Transformation |
|  [TeamOps](https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/) |  Focuses on finding solutions to the following challenges: Delays in decision making, Meeting fatigue, Poor internal communication, Slow transfers and delays in work flow Cell |

## Free software in the professional world

My experience in the open source world has also led me to apply these principles in my professional work.  I developed an open source framework within my company, which is accessible to all employees.  Knowledge sharing, comprehensive documentation and open access to information are key elements of this approach.  This promotes transparency, innovation and collaboration, while removing barriers to communication within the company.

‚ÄúOpen source within companies helps create an innovation ecosystem where each individual can contribute to the improvement of processes and the growth of the company.  ¬ª - [Quote from Eric S. Raymond, open source thinker]

## The example of Arch Linux: a strong community

My transition to Arch Linux allowed me to fully experience the power of the open source community.  Arch Linux is not only a Linux distribution, but also an active and dedicated community.  Users and developers collaborate to maintain a robust and flexible operating system.

‚ÄúOpen source is not just about sharing code, but about sharing knowledge, skills and building lasting relationships in a strong community.  ¬ª - [Quote from Linus Torvalds]

Benefits of Open Collaboration and the Power of Community

Open collaboration and the strength of the community open the door to multiple advantages:
- Collective Innovation: The diversity of contributors and perspectives stimulates constant innovation.
- Knowledge Sharing: Open source promotes knowledge sharing, encouraging continuous learning.
- Transparency and Trust: Open collaboration builds trust and transparency within the community.
- Flexibility and Agility: Asynchronous and decentralized collaboration allows greater flexibility in work.

## Open-Source Contributions

Interaction with the open source community is an essential component of my approach.  What makes this interaction even more enriching is that it is bi-directional.  Indeed, just as the open source community provides me with exceptional tools and solutions, I strive to contribute to this same community, to the extent of my skills and means, in order to give back.

The ways to participate in the free software community are varied, and everyone can find their own way to contribute.  Contributions can take many forms:
- Bug reporting
- Suggestions for improvements or new features
- Code writing
- Review of the participations of other contributors,
- Translation
- Presentation
- Pedagogy (Videos, Articles, participation in associations)
- Support via forums, reddit, discord channels

Personally, I actively engage in several open source projects, depending on my skills and interests.  My contributions include reporting bugs and proposing improvements for solutions such as OPNsense and NextCloud.  I also contributed by creating YAML descriptors for TrueNAS, doing translations for Arch Linux and Cardiac's [Architect](https://github.com/Cardiacman13/Architect) project, as well as working on the implementation in good shape to develop the Architect project, which aims to simplify the use of Arch Linux for desktop users.

During the year 2023, I have modestly made around 200 contributions to these different open source projects.  My involvement in the free software community is a way of thanking and supporting the developers and contributors who have enabled the creation of the tools I rely on every day.  It is also a way of participating in the continuous improvement of this software and of giving back to the community what it has offered me in terms of freedom, transparency, and reliability.

# VI.  Let's spread the message!  <a name="message"/>

My commitment to open source is not limited to personal or professional use, it goes well beyond.  This is a deep conviction that I hold with passion, and one of my missions is to inform, share and educate around the benefits of open source and the philosophy that accompanies it.

## üìñ Information instead of conversion 
It is essential to clarify that my objective is not to convert, but above all to inform.  I believe that open source is an approach that deserves to be better understood and appreciated.  That's why I strive to share information, explain the benefits, and shed light on the philosophy behind this approach.  I want everyone to be able to make informed decisions when it comes to technology.

## üêß The Open Source Community 
The open source community is one of the jewels of this approach.  It is made up of passionate, curious and welcoming people, ready to share their knowledge and welcome new people every day.  This vibrant community is an invaluable source of knowledge and inspiration.  It embodies the values ‚Äã‚Äãof open source, such as collaboration, transparency and generosity.

## üß† More than a question of tools 
Open source is not only a question of technical or technological tools, it is also a question of state of mind.  This encompasses transparency, a taste for transmission and sharing of knowledge.  I believe that open source is an invitation to continuous learning, collaborative creation and constant improvement.

## üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Education for kids 
One of my priorities is to inform young people about the dark side of social networks and to make them aware of the importance of being careful online.  I strive to transmit values ‚Äã‚Äãof vigilance, not to expose oneself too much on the Internet and not to share anything too important.  These fundamental lessons are essential to protecting privacy and digital security.  My own children are the primary beneficiaries, and it's gratifying to see them understand the importance of these messages in their own way, like the simple "It's cool Linux" uttered by my oldest.

LinkedIn as a Vector of Communication: LinkedIn, the professional platform, also plays a key role in my approach to evangelizing open source.  It's a space where I can interact with enthusiasts, remembrancers and Linuxians from all walks of life.  I observe with satisfaction the growth of this community day after day.  It is an ideal vector for communicating and informing.  I am aware that my job requires a certain reserve, but I believe that curiosity has never hurt anyone.  Sharing knowledge and encouraging constructive discussions about open source helps broaden horizons and promote more informed use of technology.

Ultimately, open source evangelism is a mission close to my heart.  It is a way of contributing to the dissemination of essential values ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as freedom, transparency and collaboration, and of ensuring that open source finds its place in a constantly evolving digital world.

# VII.  This is not a conclusion <a name="continue"/>

This article was an opportunity to share my journey towards exclusively using open source tools and taking a deep approach to open source in my daily life.  It is essential to remember that my approach and this article are above all informative.  I'm not here to impose dogma, but to encourage thought and discussion about the benefits of open source, transparency, and the philosophy behind them.

My journey has given me a deeper understanding of open source and its benefits.  It‚Äôs a process that can be rewarding, even if it doesn‚Äôt require as profound a transformation as mine.  Applying some key concepts of open source philosophy in your daily life can be an interesting experience.  If you're used to silos, lack of information, and a "one-size-fits-all" approach, experience transparency.  You will be surprised how your loved ones, peers and colleagues can return it to you.

There are many ways to get involved in the world of open source, whether through QA (quality assurance), translation, sharing experiences, sharing discoveries, testing, failures, feedback, collaboration on projects or innovation alone or in a group.  In recent years, I have enjoyed contributing to the projects and tools I use on a daily basis.  This manifests itself through bug reports, translations, or even my active participation in projects such as "Architect", which aims to make Arch Linux more user-friendly for a full desktop experience.

If you're interested in a transformation of this magnitude, keep in mind that the learning curve can be steep at first.  However, with perseverance, it becomes smoother and smoother as you progress.  Today, I continue to learn, but maintaining my open source environment requires little time.  This journey to open source is an invitation to continuous learning, innovation and collaboration.  It‚Äôs a journey that can bring both personal and professional benefits, and I encourage you to discover it in your own way.  The open source philosophy is an invaluable resource, and it is within reach of anyone who wishes to embark on this rewarding path.

For my part, in a logic of learning and continuous innovation, the adventure continues and your comments are welcome to help this little world progress ü§ü
